# Scandiweb React Junior Test

This repository contains my solution to the Scandiweb React Junior Test. The project is a simple e-commerce website that allows users to browse products, add them to their cart, and checkout. The website is built using React and incorporates several tools and technologies including HTML, CSS, TypeScript, Material UI, styled components, GraphQL, React Router, and Redux Toolkit.

## Features

- TypeScript: Used to add static typing to the project and improve code readability and maintainability.
- Material UI: Used to create consistent and visually appealing UI components throughout the website.
- Styled Components: Used to add styles to components and improve overall code organization and readability.
- GraphQL: Used to query and fetch data from the server in a more efficient and flexible way.
- Redux Toolkit: Used to manage the state of the application and simplify common Redux tasks.
- React Router: Used to provide routing functionality and enable navigation between pages.
- Dark Mode: Used to add a toggle switch that allows users to switch between light and dark mode.
- Responsive Design: Used to ensure that the website looks good and functions properly on all screen sizes.

In addition, the website also features a persistent shopping cart which means that when the page is refreshed, the products still remain in the cart.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into different folders that contain related files. Here is a brief overview of the folder structure:

- src: Contains all source code files.
  - assets: Contains static assets such as images and fonts.
  - components: Contains reusable UI components.
  - pages: Contains pages that correspond to different routes in the application.
  - graphql: Contains all GraphQL queries and mutations.
  - redux: Contains all Redux-related code such as actions, reducers, and store configuration.
  - theme: Contains the Material UI theme configuration.
  - functions: Contains utility functions used throughout the project.
  
## Usage

To use the website, simply navigate to the homepage and browse the available products. Click on a product to view more details and add it to the cart. You can then view your cart, adjust the quantity of products, and proceed to checkout. The website is fully responsive, so it should work well on all screen sizes. You can also switch between light and dark mode by clicking on the website logo in the header.
